/*Arrays */

var myArray = [100,200,300,"Swapnil","Shrikant"];

console.log(myArray);


// myArray[5] = "Kailash";
// myArray[7] = "Sneha";
// myArray[6] = "Akshay";
// Adding a Array.

/* Important in Array*/
//Array is driven by objects and so it is accesed using properties [] because it accesed using index
//and the indexes are no.
//js converts property no to a value String. when it comes to array.

//length of array
console.log(myArray.length);
//length doesn't count a property it count a index.
