// Is String a primitive?
//No its not eg; var greet = "Hello WOrld";
//to access length of string greet.length

var greet = "Hello WOrld";
console.log(greet);
//now the object will be created to make the variable.length work.

console.log(greet.length);

//type of the object is created 
console.log(typeof"greet");
